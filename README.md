# GeoSSL

This repository contains the code for the paper "[*Self-Supervised Learning for Scene Classification in Remote Sensing: current State of the Art and Perspectives*](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/16/3995)".

## Implemented Methods

 - [SimCLR](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/chen20j/chen20j.pdf)[1]
 - [Momentum Contrast (v2)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04297.pdf)[2] (MoCo v2)
 - [BarlowTwins](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/zbontar21a/zbontar21a.pdf)[3]
 - [Bootstrap Your Own Latent](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/f3ada80d5c4ee70142b17b8192b2958e-Paper.pdf)[4] (BYOL)

## Installing

`geossl` was tested with and has the following dependencies:

```
python>=3.7
pytorch=1.10.2+cu102
torchvision=0.11.3+cu102
torchgeo=0.3.0
```

Exact dependencies are specified in the [`environment.yml`](https://github.com/Pangoraw/geossl/blob/main/environment.yml) file and it can be used to create an associated conda environment:

```bash
conda env create --file ./environment.yml
```

## Usage

The [`train_evaluate.py`](https://github.com/Pangoraw/geossl/blob/main/train_evaluate.py) script perform a self-supervised pre-training and evaluate the pre-trained model on the linear-evaluation protocol and fine-tuning (with 1% and 10% respectively). An example usage is available in [`scripts/train_evaluate.sh`](https://github.com/Pangoraw/geossl/blob/main/scripts/train_evaluate.sh).

## Pre-trained weights

The following pre-trained weights are available to download:

|Backbone|Pre-training dataset|Method|Identifier|
|--------|--------------------|------|----------|
|ResNet18|EuroSAT|SimCLR|`"resnet18/eurosat/simclr"`|
|ResNet18|EuroSAT|MoCo v2|`"resnet18/eurosat/moco"`|
|ResNet18|EuroSAT|BYOL|`"resnet18/eurosat/byol"`|
|ResNet18|EuroSAT|Barlow Twins|`"resnet18/eurosat/barlow"`|

There is an helper on the backbone class to instantiate the model with the pre-trained weights:

```python
from geossl.backbones import ResNetBackbone

model = ResNetBackbone.from_pretrained("resnet18/eurosat/simclr")
```

> **Note**
> Pre-trained weights for the Resisc-45 dataset will be released soon.
